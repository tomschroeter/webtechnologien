<h1 class="mt-3">My Favorites</h1>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <h4>Favorites Feature</h4>
    <p>This feature would display your favorite artworks. The favorites functionality would need to be implemented with a database table to store user favorites and proper integration with the artwork display system.</p>
    <p>For now, this is a placeholder that maintains the same URL structure as the original favorites.php page.</p>
