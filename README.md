# Web-Technologien App
Gruppe 2: Tom Schröter, Kian van der Meer, Tim Fuchs, Carlos Slaiwa, Arne Gutschik

This app is being created as part of our course "Web-Technologien" at the TH Wildau.
It is a PHP web app that is an art showcase site, including pages for artists, genres & subjects. Users can register/login and rate different paintings and favorite them as well as artists.

## Setup
Make sure you have XAMPP installed and have added the art DB that was provided.

1. Run the Apache Web Server
2. Run the MySQL Database
3. Got to the browser on http://localhost/webtechnologien to see the main page

## Routing
This app uses filebased routing by default. Routes are therefore based on the folder structure, e.g. app/index.php -> http://localhost/app & app/about/index.php -> http://localhost/app/about.

If you want to link to another page you can do the following:
- href="about" -> http://localhost/app/about
- href="/about" -> http://localhost/about (avoid this)
- href="" -> http://localhost/app, returns to main page
- href="about/another_page" -> use this to go to more nested routes
