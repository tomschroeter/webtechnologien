# MVC Architecture Implementation Summary

## What has been implemented

### 1. MVC Structure Created
- **Models**: Using existing repositories and DTOs as the Model layer
- **Views**: Created view templates in `/src/views/` directory
- **Controllers**: Created controller classes in `/src/controllers/` directory

### 2. Controllers Implemented
- `BaseController.php` - Base controller with common functionality
- `HomeController.php` - Home page controller
- `ArtistController.php` - Artists listing and individual artist pages
- `ArtworkController.php` - Artworks listing and individual artwork pages
- `GenreController.php` - Genres listing and individual genre pages
- `SubjectController.php` - Subjects listing and individual subject pages
- `AuthController.php` - Authentication-related pages (login, register, account)
- `AdminController.php` - Admin functionality (manage users)
- `ErrorController.php` - New controller for handling error pages
- `SearchController.php` - Moved search functionality to MVC architecture

### 3. Views Created
- `layouts/main.php` - Main layout template
- `home/index.php` - Home page view
- `artists/index.php` - Artists listing view
- `artists/show.php` - Individual artist view
- `artworks/index.php` - Artworks listing view
- `artworks/show.php` - Individual artwork view
- `genres/index.php` - Genres listing view
- `genres/show.php` - Individual genre view
- `subjects/index.php` - Subjects listing view
- `subjects/show.php` - Individual subject view
- `auth/login.php` - Login page view (placeholder)
- `errors/404.php` - Styled 404 error page
- `errors/500.php` - Styled 500 error page
- `search/index.php` - Search results view with improved styling

### 4. Routing System
- `FrontController.php` - Main routing controller
- `mvc_bootstrap.php` - Bootstrap file that tries MVC first, falls back to original
- Updated existing PHP files to check MVC routing first

### 5. Key Features
- **Backward Compatibility**: All original functionality is preserved
- **Gradual Migration**: MVC routes are tried first, original files serve as fallback
- **Flash Messages**: Implemented flash message system for user feedback
- **Template System**: Views use a layout system with content injection
- **Authentication Helpers**: Base controller includes auth-related helper methods

## How it works

1. When a user visits a URL, the MVC bootstrap is called first
2. The FrontController checks if there's a matching MVC route
3. If found, it instantiates the appropriate controller and calls the method
4. The controller processes the request, prepares data, and renders a view
5. If no MVC route matches, the original PHP file handles the request

## Routes Implemented in MVC
- `GET /` → HomeController::index()
- `GET /index` → HomeController::index()
- `GET /artists` → ArtistController::index()
- `GET /artists/{id}` → ArtistController::show($id)
- `GET /artworks` → ArtworkController::index()
- `GET /artworks/{id}` → ArtworkController::show($id)
- `GET /genres` → GenreController::index()
- `GET /genres/{id}` → GenreController::show($id)
- `GET /subjects` → SubjectController::index()
- `GET /subjects/{id}` → SubjectController::show($id)
- `GET /login` → AuthController::showLogin()
- `GET /register` → AuthController::showRegister()
- `GET /account` → AuthController::showAccount()
- `GET /favorites` → AuthController::showFavorites()
- `GET /manage-users` → AdminController::manageUsers()
- `GET /search` → SearchController::index()

## Files Modified
- `index.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `artists.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `artworks.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `genres.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `subjects.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `display-single-artist.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `display-single-artwork.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `error.php` - Legacy error handling now redirects to MVC error system
- `search.php` - Now redirects to MVC route for backward compatibility

## Recent Updates

### Migration from Main Branch (June 2025)
- **Merge Conflicts Resolved** - Successfully merged main branch with updated styling and fonts
- **New Content Migrated** - Updated views with new styling, fonts (Lobster, Lato), and improved layouts
- **Removed Legacy Files** - Cleaned up old files that were replaced by MVC structure:
  - `about.php` → MVC about route
  - `artists.php` → MVC artists route  
  - `artworks.php` → MVC artworks route
  - `genres.php` → MVC genres route
  - `subjects.php` → MVC subjects route
  - `display-single-artist.php` → MVC artist show route
  - `display-single-artwork.php` → MVC artwork show route
  - `display-single-genre.php` → MVC genre show route
  - `display-single-subject.php` → MVC subject show route
- **Updated Views** - All MVC views now use the latest styling and content
- **Enhanced CSS** - Combined AJAX/favorites functionality with new font styling
- **Improved Components** - Updated artwork-card-list with enhanced favorites functionality

### 404 Error Handling Implementation (June 2025)
- **ErrorController.php** - New controller for handling error pages
- **views/errors/404.php** - Styled 404 error page
- **views/errors/500.php** - Styled 500 error page
- **Updated FrontController** - Now properly handles non-existent routes with 404 pages
- **Updated error.php** - Legacy error handling now redirects to MVC error system
- **Static File Handling** - System properly distinguishes between missing pages and static assets

### Search MVC Implementation
- **SearchController.php** - Moved search functionality to MVC architecture
- **views/search/index.php** - Search results view with improved styling
- **Updated navbar** - Search form now uses `/search` route instead of `/search.php`
- **search.php** - Now redirects to MVC route for backward compatibility

### Testing 404 Functionality
To test the 404 system:
1. Visit any non-existent URL (e.g., `/non-existent-page`)
2. Try accessing a non-existent artist ID (e.g., `/artists/999999`)
3. Check that static assets still work (e.g., `/assets/style.css`)
4. Verify specific error messages appear for different error types

## Architecture Benefits
- **Centralized Error Handling**: All 404s and errors go through consistent system
- **Better UX**: Styled error pages instead of default browser 404s
- **SEO Friendly**: Proper HTTP status codes (404, 500) are sent
- **Maintainable**: Error handling logic is centralized and reusable

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Migrate remaining pages (login, register, account, etc.) to MVC
2. Add POST route handling for forms
3. Implement more sophisticated error handling
4. Add middleware support for authentication
5. Create admin views and functionality
6. Add API endpoints for AJAX functionality

## Benefits Achieved
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, presentation, and data are now separated
- **Code Reusability**: Controllers and views can be reused
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend
- **Testability**: Controllers can be unit tested
- **Consistency**: Standardized way of handling requests
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features following MVC pattern
