# MVC Architecture Implementation Summary

## What has been implemented

### 1. MVC Structure Created
- **Models**: Using existing repositories and DTOs as the Model layer
- **Views**: Created view templates in `/src/views/` directory
- **Controllers**: Created controller classes in `/src/controllers/` directory

### 2. Controllers Implemented
- `BaseController.php` - Base controller with common functionality
- `HomeController.php` - Home page controller
- `ArtistController.php` - Artists listing and individual artist pages
- `ArtworkController.php` - Artworks listing and individual artwork pages
- `GenreController.php` - Genres listing and individual genre pages
- `SubjectController.php` - Subjects listing and individual subject pages
- `AuthController.php` - Authentication-related pages (login, register, account)
- `AdminController.php` - Admin functionality (user management)

### 3. Views Created
- `layouts/main.php` - Main layout template
- `home/index.php` - Home page view
- `artists/index.php` - Artists listing view
- `artists/show.php` - Individual artist view
- `artworks/index.php` - Artworks listing view
- `artworks/show.php` - Individual artwork view
- `genres/index.php` - Genres listing view
- `genres/show.php` - Individual genre view
- `subjects/index.php` - Subjects listing view
- `subjects/show.php` - Individual subject view
- `auth/login.php` - Login page view (placeholder)

### 4. Routing System
- `FrontController.php` - Main routing controller
- `mvc_bootstrap.php` - Bootstrap file that tries MVC first, falls back to original
- Updated existing PHP files to check MVC routing first

### 5. Key Features
- **Backward Compatibility**: All original functionality is preserved
- **Gradual Migration**: MVC routes are tried first, original files serve as fallback
- **Flash Messages**: Implemented flash message system for user feedback
- **Template System**: Views use a layout system with content injection
- **Authentication Helpers**: Base controller includes auth-related helper methods

## How it works

1. When a user visits a URL, the MVC bootstrap is called first
2. The FrontController checks if there's a matching MVC route
3. If found, it instantiates the appropriate controller and calls the method
4. The controller processes the request, prepares data, and renders a view
5. If no MVC route matches, the original PHP file handles the request

## Routes Implemented in MVC
- `GET /` → HomeController::index()
- `GET /index` → HomeController::index()
- `GET /artists` → ArtistController::index()
- `GET /artists/{id}` → ArtistController::show($id)
- `GET /artworks` → ArtworkController::index()
- `GET /artworks/{id}` → ArtworkController::show($id)
- `GET /genres` → GenreController::index()
- `GET /genres/{id}` → GenreController::show($id)
- `GET /subjects` → SubjectController::index()
- `GET /subjects/{id}` → SubjectController::show($id)
- `GET /login` → AuthController::showLogin()
- `GET /register` → AuthController::showRegister()
- `GET /account` → AuthController::showAccount()
- `GET /favorites` → AuthController::showFavorites()
- `GET /manage-users` → AdminController::manageUsers()

## Files Modified
- `index.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `artists.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `artworks.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `genres.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `subjects.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `display-single-artist.php` - Added MVC bootstrap
- `display-single-artwork.php` - Added MVC bootstrap

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Migrate remaining pages (login, register, account, etc.) to MVC
2. Add POST route handling for forms
3. Implement more sophisticated error handling
4. Add middleware support for authentication
5. Create admin views and functionality
6. Add API endpoints for AJAX functionality

## Benefits Achieved
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, presentation, and data are now separated
- **Code Reusability**: Controllers and views can be reused
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend
- **Testability**: Controllers can be unit tested
- **Consistency**: Standardized way of handling requests
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features following MVC pattern
